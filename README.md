Please note that the current version does not include a proper frontend, as this setup is primarily for backend testing purposes. The frontend will be updated shortly and i accept pull request.

I developed a robust e-commerce backend application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). 
This project focuses primarily on building and testing the backend functionalities essential for any e-commerce platform.
It includes user authentication, product management, order handling, and secure API endpoints.
The backend is built with Node.js and Express, using MongoDB as the database to store user, product, and order data. 
While the current live demo lacks a fully developed frontend, it serves as a working foundation for testing backend APIs. 
I plan to integrate a modern, responsive frontend using React soon to complete the full-stack application. 
This project demonstrates a scalable and modular approach to backend development for e-commerce systems.
